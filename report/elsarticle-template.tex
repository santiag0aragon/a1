\section*{Assignment 1}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Part A:}
We developed an application mixnets.py [Appendix A] to send messages via the three mixs and the cache node that forwards the individual messages to the recipient. 
\newline

\textbf{Part B:}
We sent a message to TIM from the send message method as shown below in mixnets.py application [Appendix A]. 
\begin{verbatim}send_message('TIM     ','s1750542  and  s1736574') \end{verbatim}

\textbf{Part C:}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Frequency of messages received against time in the same second.}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{one_c}
\end{figure}

We parsed the cache log to analyse the data fields of individual messages separately and performed frequency analysis as shown in Figure: 1 by counting the number of messages received in a particular second and plotted the results in a bar chart graph. We observed that mostly seven messages were received in the cache log in a particular second, however in certain instances, the average of messages received in two seconds was seven. We therefore concluded that :

\begin{center}
Threshold of $n_A$ = $n_B$ = $n_C$ = 7
\end{center}



\section*{Assignment 2}
\textbf{Part A:}
\newline

We sent individual messages one by one with a short time delay and observed the output via the cache log by parsing the message fields. We observed that the messages forwarded by MIX C to the CACHE NODE had a frequency of mostly 6 or 9. We learned that the sum of messages received in one or two seconds was always a factor of 3, as shown in Figure: 2. Therefore, we came to the conclusion that threshold of $n_C$ is 3.
\newline
\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Frequency of messages received against time in the same second.}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{second}
\end{figure}
\newline
We kept a count of the messages entering the second mixnet via MIX A and the messages received in the cache log after reaching the threshold $n_C$. After the initial 8 messages passed through MIX A, only 6 messages were displayed in the cache log, that denotes that the threshold of MIX B and MIX A is $\leq$ 8. We sent more messages one by one until a second batch of 6 messages were received in the cache log. We noted that after sending 7 more messages, another batch of 6 messages was received in the cache log, this further helped us to analyse and conclude that the threshold of MIX B and MIX A is $\leq$ 7, because the minimum threshold of MIX A can be 1 and since there were 2 unreceived messages, therefore MIX B required 6 more messages to reach its threshold of 7 messages.   We also kept a count of the messages sent into the mixnet that were not received by the cache log. Keeping in mind the maximum threshold possible for MIX B to receive the next batch of 6 message in the cache log. 
\newline
We observed that after ..
\newline
We learned...
\newline
\newline
\begin{center}
Threshold of $n_A$ is 2

Threshold of $n_B$ is 7

Threshold of $n_C$ is 3
\end{center}
